# Quiz-Host-MERN-HEROKU-FINAL
Quiz Host is a quiz creation and hosting app built using the MERN stack.
It utilizes a custom made NodeJs API with a diverse set of user permissions and endpoints.
All users can search and access any quiz made public.
Currently, only the public quiz views are tracked but comments, score stats, and likes will be added in the future.
Users can create an account to create quizzes, manage public quizzes, and manage work-in-progress quizzes.
This is a full CRUD application that utilizes React, NodeJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React's Context API, and React-Router-DOM.
Logged out users can only access public quizzes, the user name of the quiz creator, and the view count. 
This app will be improved upon in the future.
